    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Disclaimer: I found this recipe on Instagram reels and fell in love at first sight and sent it to my girlfriend. Upon actually going to make this recipe, we discovered the measurements were not in the caption and we had to actually pay for somebody's cookbook so it is made based purely on vibes and feelings.
    </p>

    <p>
        Pasta. Bacon. White Wine. Red Onion. Parmesan. Eat your heart out.
    </p>

    <p>
        The combination of saltiness from the bacon, the sweetness from the red onion and the richness the white wine adds is what makes this the ultimate bacon pasta recipe. Without forgetting a sprinkle of parmesan on top to add that final finishing touch.
        
        Imagine yourself as Remy from Ratatouille eating cheese and strawberries but instead you're tucking into a nice hearty bowl of this bacon pasta. Don't forget to serve with some form of bread, I recommend M&S San Francisco sourdough, so you don't waste an ounce of the sauce.
